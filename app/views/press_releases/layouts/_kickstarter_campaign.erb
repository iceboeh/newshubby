															<em>About Kickstarter by Kickstarter:</em><br>
															Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. A home for film, music, art, theater, games, comics, design, photography, and more. Together, creators and backers make projects happen. Project creators set a funding goal and deadline. If people like a project, they can pledge money to make it happen. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing â€” projects must reach their funding goals to receive any money.
